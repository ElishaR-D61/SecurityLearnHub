# Security Operations

## Overview
Security Operations represent a comprehensive and coordinated effort to safeguard digital assets, systems, and data from an increasingly complex and evolving threat landscape. These operations encompass a wide range of strategic and technical functions designed to anticipate, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. Whether addressing external threats such as cyberattacks or mitigating internal risks like misconfigurations and human error, security teams play a critical role in ensuring the resilience and integrity of an organisationâ€™s information infrastructure.
